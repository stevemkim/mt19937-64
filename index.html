<h2> Mersenne Twister 64bit version </h2>

<a href="mt64.html">Japanese Version</a>

<p>
    Here is a C code of Mersenne Twister for 64 bit machines,
   <a href="./VERSIONS/C-LANG/mt19937-64.c"> mt19937-64.c </a>,
    with period 2^19937-1. And its output <a href="mt19937-64.out.txt">
mt19937-64.out.txt</a>.
</p>
<p>
    The recursion is similar but different, so the output is totally different
from the 32-bit versions.
</p>

<p>
    Here is an archive file <a href="mt19937-64.tgz">mt19937-64.tgz</a> and
<a href="mt19937-64stdint.tgz">mt19937-64stdint.tgz</a>. In mt19937-64stdint.tgz
64-bit unsigned integer is declared as uint64_t and 64-bit unsigned immediate
value is declared using UINT64_C.
It includes header file mt64.h and test main function file mt19937-64test.c.
The file mt19937.c in this archive does not have main function. The archive has
files listed below.
</p>
<ul>
<li>mt19937-64.c</li>
<li>mt19937-64test.c</li>
<li>mt64.h</li>
<li>mt19937-64.out.txt</li>
</ul>
<p>
(2007/2/8) Adam Ierymenko informed us of a very simple speed up:
see <a href="Ierymenko.html">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
(2008/12/4) Change the argument definition of init_by_array to
obey ANSI standard.

  If you want a twice to four times faster variant of MT,
   there is one designed for SIMD CPUs. It is faster than
   the original MT, even in non-SIMD CPUs, and has better
   assurance of randomenss. It also supports 64-bit output.
